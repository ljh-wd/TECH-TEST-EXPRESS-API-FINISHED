# 3D Group technical assessment - Express api

## What have we provided you

We have provided you with a very simple node express scaffold. There is only one endpoint that handles a GET request made to `/`.

## Setup

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage the node version required by this application. Once you have nvm available on your computer, run the following command to install the correct node version provided in `.nvmrc`:

```sh
nvm install
```

Once the correct node version is installed, you can run the following command to use this version:

```sh
nvm use
```

## What is your task

From the `/` endpoint, you must serve the data stored in `src/data.json` as a JSON response.

## What should you do once you have completed the task

Please upload the app to your GitHub account and provide us with a link.

## Additional notes

- The only file to which you should make any changes is `src/index.ts`.
- The application should serve only one endpoint, which we have provided for you.
- This is one part of the technical assessment (the backend part). This is to accompany the other part of the technical assessment (the frontend part).
